# gloob-game
A respository for video game development project

Controlls:
Movement - WASD
Jump     - SPACE
Fire     - Q
Pause    - ESC (WIP) 
Unpause  - ESC (WIP)

Gamplay:
Gloob's hp bar and ammo bar share the same resource! When gloob attacks, his projectiles will bounce off targets and Gloob and pick up the ammo/hp! He can't fire if he has 1 hp left and will perform a dash instead(not implemented yet).
Each room will open once gloob defeats all requiered enemies!

Current bugs:
Gloob will get stuck on thin platforms and doors when moving across them. Jump to unstuck gloob.
